# BooklistApp
Simple Booklist App made in vanilla JavaScript based on a YouTube tutorial

The purpose of this small project is to get familiar with basic concepts of HTML, Bootstrap and JavScript
We made a booklist application that a user can:
- Add a book
- Remove a book
- View all the book list that he has added

Also, the books are saved on a json file that is being used as the storage of the application.

Tools:
HTML, CSS(Bootstrap), JavScript
